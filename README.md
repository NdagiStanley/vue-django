# vue-django-webpack-boilerplate

> [@NdagiStanley](https://github.com/NdagiStanley) has mirrored the [fork](https://github.com/NdagiStanley/vue-django-fork) to have this repo here. This starterpack has proved useful to many and I thank you for the emails I have received from all of you. The reasoning behind this mirror is that; this is an effort to **support the users** more by developing further on this project. From here on, I am calling on all potential collaborators by making it easier to make [PRs](https://github.com/NdagiStanley/vue-django/pulls) and adding the utility of [Issues](https://github.com/NdagiStanley/vue-django/issues) in this 'new' repo (Of course with the same name ðŸ˜€ ). Lastly, just so you know, I'll be keeping up with developments in the [`original`](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack).

## Vue CLI Version Notice

If you are using `vue-cli@1.x`, it will be pulling the `master` branch of this template by default. If you are using `vue-cli@2.x`, it will be pulling the `dist` branch instead, which provides more configurable options thanks to new features in `vue-cli@2.x`. It is recommended to upgrade `vue-cli` as soon as you can.

## VueJS Templates Documentation

Common topics are discussed in the [docs](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack). Make sure to read it!

[https://vuedjango.herokuapp.com/](https://vuedjango.herokuapp.com/) is a deployed instance of this boilerplate.

[Vue-Django Docs](https://ndagistanley.github.io/vue-django/) offer a more comprehensive documentation.

## Usage of VueDjango

This is a project template that includes `VueJS` and `Django` based on the [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) templates. **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
```

### Set up
You might want to use ```sudo``` if you encounter permissions error
```bash
$ vue init NdagiStanley/vue-django my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
```

Secondly, have *Python* installed and preferably create a virtual environment for the project.

### Develop
Run:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

The app runs on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

Update the files as you wish and the hot-reload will take effect. Add `js` and `css` files within the `static` folder in the root directory. Link them to the index.html in that same level (the root directory).

### Deploy
Ensure you have run `npm install` prior to the following command.

Run:
```bash
$ .deploy.sh
```
(Run this command every time you make changes)

At [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) you should have a page exactly like the image below or as the deployed instance mentioned earlier: [https://vuedjango.herokuapp.com/](https://vuedjango.herokuapp.com/)

</p>

> Docker

##### Ensure that **docker** is running.

If you use `docker` in your workflow, there is a `Dockerfile` in the root directory for you. Simply run
```
docker build -t [image-name] .
```
Use your preferred _image name_ in place of the `image-name` in the command. Remember to enter the trailing period before running it.

There is a docker container for vue-django that you can run. Simply run the following command.
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 stanmd/vue-django
```

Then get to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/). You should have a page exactly like the image above
